# Data Analysis and Regression Modeling for ASEAN Energy and Economic Trends Program
This program utilizes Python and libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to analyze energy consumption and economic indicators across ASEAN member states. Beginning with data import and filtering for specific years and countries, it employs visualization techniques such as box plots and correlation heatmaps to reveal patterns and relationships between variables like biofuel, coal, and GDP. Further exploration includes identifying significant correlations and performing linear regression to predict economic outcomes based on energy consumption. Users can interact with the program to select features for analysis and predict GDP based on chosen energy metrics, offering insights into regional economic trends and energy policies.
